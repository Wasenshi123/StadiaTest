# **StadiaTest**

This project is a test for demonstrating how you can connect unity client to back-end server.

This project uses new technology from Microsoft [Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview) as a back-end server.

This project uses WebSocket protocol for communication between client and server.

This could easily be an architecture for mobile game that run the service world-wide. (because of the nature of Service Fabric)
