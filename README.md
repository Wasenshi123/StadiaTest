# **StadiaTest**

This project is a test for demonstrating how you can connect unity client to back-end server.

This project uses new technology from Microsoft [Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview) as a back-end server.

This full version of this project uses WebSocket protocol for communication between client and server. (cannot include here)

This could easily be an architecture for mobile game that run the service world-wide. (because of the nature of Service Fabric)

## **How to run server:**

You can follow the suggestion from micosoft here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-quickstart-dotnet) and install all the program

Or just open the server project with visual studio and run it.



## **Unity Client:**

Open the project in Unity3D program then start exploring in the 'Main.unity' scene
